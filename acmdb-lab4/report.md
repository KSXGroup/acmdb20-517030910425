# ACM DB Lab 3 Report

- Describe any design decisions you made, including your choice of page eviction policy. If you used something other than a nested-loops join, describe the tradeoffs of the algorithm you chose.

  I use LRU page eviction policy, when implementing the Join and HashEquiJoin operators, I refer to the corresponding Wikipedia  page for the pseudo code of the algorithm. 

- Discuss and justify any changes you made to the API.

  No API is changed during working on this project.

- Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.

  All test are passed so no incomplete elements part.

- Describe how long you spent on the lab, and whether there was anything you found particularly difficult or confusing.

  It cost me 1.5 day to finish the lab and the project.
